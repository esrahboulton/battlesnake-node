# ouroboyos nodejs battlesnake

Based on the SWU nodejs starter snake üêç

## Branches
`feature/[feature-name]` branches are used for features (new functions, etc). `test/[feature-name]` branches are used for a stable dev build of a feature. We then create a new heroku app so we can run older snakes against newer.

## App
### Main build
https://ouroboyos.herokuapp.com/
### Testing
https://ouroboyos-random.herokuapp.com/

## Running on Docker
- Run `docker run -it --rm -p 3000:3000 sendwithus/battlesnake-server`
- Visit http://localhost:3000

## TODO
1. implement forward checking to avoid getting trapped
2. review avoid function
3. review kill function
4. implement middle-out strategy
5. implement space checking to choose the move with more space
6. implement a check to allow for tail moves (moving into a tail if the snake is not eating)
